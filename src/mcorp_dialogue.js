  `Attention San Vansterdam: We are officially 'reshaping' M-CORP to better support our long-term yacht acquisitions. Several builder roles have been 'impacted' to focus on what matters most: Premium Vests. I have a hard stop in 30 seconds.`,
  `To our community: Tens of millions of you have stepped into the plaza. To celebrate, we’ve 'transformed' our team structure by liquidating the architectural staff so we can 'move faster.' ${frankId}, do the math or face eviction.`,
  `Q2 projections require immediate restructuring. We are cutting the dead weight who actually pour the concrete. If you are loitering without a Premium Battle Pass, you will be 'impacted' next.`,
  `The 'Founder's Pack' pricing has been adjusted to $89.99. This decision is not a reflection of our 'impacted' developers' talent, but a reflection of my quarterly bonus requirements. Vacate the premises.`,
  `M-CORP is not 'broke.' We are 'optimizing our capital' by replacing 40 senior engineers with one highly stressed intern. ${frankId}, stop spreading misinformation. I am turning my pager off.`,

  `Knob Day is ahead of schedule due to streamlined operations. I am now personally responsible for knobbing every ledge in San Vansterdam since the maintenance staff was transitioned. No exceptions.`,
  `Code Violation: Cooking meat on an internal combustion engine. ${frankId}, consider this a cease-and-desist. My entire security team was 'impacted' this morning, so I will have to enforce this myself eventually.`,
  `Security personnel have been reduced by 98% so we can 'listen more closely' to shareholders. I am authorized to use physical force if I can jog over to you in time. I'm muting this channel.`,
  `Failure to wear a high-visibility M-CORP vest results in an immediate plaza shutdown. ${frankId}, consider this your final warning. I am currently performing janitorial duties in Sector 4 and cannot be disturbed.`,
  `The budget for 10,000 additional screw knobs has been approved by cutting the plaza maintenance fund to zero. San Vansterdam will be un-skateable by Friday. Do not reply to this automated alert.`,

  `What is up board-shredders! M-CORP is transforming as a studio! We synergized the payroll by letting go of the people who make the ramps! Catching you dudes next fiscal quarter!`,
  `Knob Day is vital to our new agile framework. Gluing knobs to ledges with a skeleton crew is an essential community service. I will review your compliance metrics next quarter.`,
  `San Vansterdam is being pivoted! We 'impacted' the concrete division to pivot into a centralized data-mining hub. ${frankId}, encourage your associates to invest immediately.`,
  `Street skating is no longer supported due to recent team structure shifts. M-CORP VR-Hoverboarding is the only approved transit method. I am AFK for a three-week executive retreat.`,
  `Knob Day is mandatory. I have secured my 59 screw knobs to the rail myself, since the installation team was liquidated. It is a highly efficient use of resources. ${frankId}, report back.`,

  `Per Mr. Todd: We are 'moving faster and listening more closely.' Also I am now the Lead Engineer, Head of HR, and Head Janitor. Please don't contact me again, I haven't slept in three days.`,
  `The lights in the M-CORP server room are non-functional. The guy who changes the bulbs was 'impacted' this morning. ${frankId}, do not mention my current location to Mr. Todd.`,
  `Mr. Todd requested I announce that development is proceeding as planned, but there's literally no one left in the office except me and a potted plant. I am searching for Gary's clipboard.`,
  `${frankId}, I require the location of the master keys. Mr. Todd is extremely agitated that the plaza isn't updating itself automatically anymore. I am currently unavailable for further comment.`,
  `There was a logistical error. I accidentally fired the remaining 59 employees instead of ordering 59 screw knobs. Gary is going to end my internship. I am vacating the premises.`,
