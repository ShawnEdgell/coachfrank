  `Attention San Vansterdam, Todd here. I have a hard stop in 45 seconds. Just popping in to say the Isle of Grom is a premium destination designed to keep the riff-raff out. Anyway, my helicopter is here. Let's circle back in Q3!`,
  `Listen up, I want to dispel these unfounded rumors. We aren't abandoning the city, we just invested heavily in M-CORP branded vests. Do the math! Gotta run, ${frankId}, I have a 2 PM deep-tissue massage.`,
  `Just saw the Q2 projections. We are NOT liquidating San Vansterdam, despite what you heard. I have to go buy a boat. ${frankId}, stop loitering and buy the premium pass.`,
  `Quick update: The Isle of Grom 'Founder's Pack' is now $89.99. It's called inflation, learn basic economics. My assistant is waving at me, I'm late for a synergy retreat.`,
  `To whoever is saying M-CORP is broke: my wife did NOT eat 200 chips out of stress last night! She ate them because they are delicious! I'm turning my pager off now.`,

  `Happy early Knob Day! I'm leaving 59 screw knobs at the front desk. I expect every slappy curb in the plaza knobbed by 5 PM. I can't stay to monitor you, I have a citation to write.`,
  `Attention: Cooking meat on an engine block is a severe San Vansterdam health code violation. ${frankId}, I'm dropping this official M-CORP cease-and-desist and logging off for a lanyard seminar.`,
  `I am actively deploying security to tackle anyone caught grinding the plaza fountain. It's for your own safety. I'm muting this channel to go inspect a suspicious ledge. Good day.`,
  `If I see one more person without a high-visibility M-CORP vest, I'm shutting down the plaza. ${frankId}, consider this your final warning.`,
  `Just approved the budget for 10,000 more screw knobs. San Vansterdam will be 100% un-skateable by Friday. You're welcome!`,

  `What is up my fellow board-shredders?! Can we synergize your street session with a sponsored M-CORP digital collectible drop? Think about it! Catching you dudes next fiscal quarter!`,
  `Knob Day is going to be so totally rad this year! Gluing knobs to ledges is just a really cool thing to do! Anyway, I've got a matcha tasting at 3:00, so peace out!`,
  `San Vansterdam! We're pivoting the plaza into a crypto-mining hub! So stoked for the synergy! ${frankId}, tell your friends to invest!`,
  `Just a reminder that street skating is out, and M-CORP sanctioned VR-Hoverboarding is IN! It's totally boss, no cap! AFK for three weeks for a retreat in Bali.`,
  `Who's ready for Knob Day?! I just glued my 59 screw knobs to a rail and it felt incredibly empowering. You guys should try it! ${frankId}, catch you on the flip-side.`,

  `Um, Mr. Todd told me to drop this off. It's a bill for the bandwidth you're using in the plaza. Please don't yell at me, I'm already late to fetch Gary's dry cleaning.`,
  `Nobody panic! The lights just went off in the M-CORP server room but it's totally fine! I tripped over the cord! ${frankId}, please don't tell anyone I'm in the supply closet.`,
  `Mr. Todd told me to tell everyone the Isle of Grom is doing great, but I just saw him crying in his office. I have to go find Gary's missing clipboard now.`,
  `Hey ${frankId}... did you see where I left the master keys to the M-CORP server room? Mr. Todd is screaming and his wife is buying more chips. I'm going to hide in the vents.`,
  `I accidentally ordered 59,000 screw knobs instead of 59. Gary is going to end my internship. If anyone asks, I was never here. I'm running away.`,
