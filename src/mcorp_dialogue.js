  `Attention: M-CORP has acquired the remaining public sectors of San Vansterdam. The Isle of Grom is now a private-access zone. Riff-raff will be escorted out by private security. I have a hard stop in 30 seconds.`,
  `The deployment of M-CORP branded high-visibility vests is mandatory for all plaza residents. This is a non-negotiable safety directive. ${frankId}, do the math or face eviction.`,
  `Q2 projections require immediate liquidation of non-performing assets. If you are loitering without an active Premium Battle Pass, you are a non-performing asset.`,
  `The 'Founder's Pack' pricing has been adjusted to $89.99 to reflect current market inflation. If you cannot afford the entry fee, vacate the premises.`,
  `M-CORP is not 'broke.' We are optimizing our capital. Any rumors to the contrary are actionable slander. ${frankId}, stop spreading misinformation. I am turning my pager off.`,

  `Knob Day is ahead of schedule. 59 screw knobs are being deployed to the front desk. I expect every ledge in the plaza to be rendered un-skateable by 17:00. No exceptions.`,
  `Code Violation: Cooking meat on an internal combustion engine is a Tier 1 health risk. ${frankId}, consider this an official cease-and-desist. I am logging off to attend a mandatory compliance seminar.`,
  `Security personnel are authorized to use physical force to remove anyone grinding the plaza fountain. This is for your own protection. I'm muting this channel to inspect a suspicious ledge.`,
  `Failure to wear a high-visibility M-CORP vest results in an immediate plaza shutdown. ${frankId}, this is your final warning. We are moving to full enforcement.`,
  `The budget for 10,000 additional screw knobs has been approved. San Vansterdam will be 100% compliant with anti-skate ordinances by Friday. Do not reply to this automated alert.`,

  `We are looking to synergize your street sessions with M-CORP digital collectibles. Increased player engagement metrics are required for continued plaza access. Think about the ROI.`,
  `Knob Day is a vital component of our urban renewal initiative. Gluing knobs to ledges is an essential community service. I will review your compliance metrics next fiscal quarter.`,
  `San Vansterdam is being pivoted into a centralized data-mining hub. This synergy is necessary for the city's survival. ${frankId}, encourage your associates to invest immediately.`,
  `Street skating is no longer a supported activity. M-CORP sanctioned VR-Hoverboarding is the only approved transit method. I am AFK for a three-week executive retreat.`,
  `Knob Day is mandatory. I have already secured my 59 screw knobs to the local rail. It is a highly efficient use of company resources. ${frankId}, report back once your sector is clear.`,

  `There was a logistical error regarding the screw knob shipment. 59,000 units have arrived. Gary is ending my internship if I don't resolve this. I am vacating the premises.`,
