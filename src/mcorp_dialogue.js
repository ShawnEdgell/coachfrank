  `Attention San Vansterdam, Todd here. I have a hard stop in 45 seconds. Just popping in to say the Isle of Grom is a premium destination designed to keep the riff-raff out. Anyway, my helicopter is here. Let's circle back in Q3! ${frankId}, thoughts? Actually, don't answer, I'm already gone.`,
  `Listen up, I want to dispel these unfounded rumors. We aren't abandoning the city, we just invested heavily in M-CORP branded vests. Do the math! Gotta run, ${frankId}, I have a 2 PM deep-tissue massage. Keep your session monetized.`,
  `Just saw the Q2 projections. We are NOT liquidating San Vansterdam, despite what you heard. I have to go buy a boat. ${frankId}, buy the premium battle pass or stop loitering.`,
  `Quick update: The Isle of Grom 'Founder's Pack' is now $89.99. It's called inflation, learn basic economics. My assistant is waving at me, I'm late for a synergy retreat. Later, ${frankId}.`,
  `To whoever is saying M-CORP is broke: my wife did NOT eat 200 chips out of stress last night! She ate them because they are delicious! ${frankId}, stop spreading lies, I'm turning my pager off.`,

  `Happy early Knob Day! I'm leaving 59 screw knobs at the front desk. ${frankId}, I expect every slappy curb in the plaza knobbed by 5 PM. I can't stay to monitor you, I have to go write a citation to a father and son having a home issue. Behave.`,
  `Attention: Cooking meat on an engine block is a severe San Vansterdam health code violation. ${frankId}, I'm dropping this official M-CORP cease-and-desist and immediately logging off to attend a 4-day seminar on high-visibility lanyards. Do not reply to this message.`,
  `I am actively deploying security to tackle anyone caught grinding the plaza fountain. It's for your own safety. ${frankId}, I'm muting this channel to go inspect a suspicious ledge. Good day.`,
  `If I see one more person without a high-visibility M-CORP vest, I'm shutting down the plaza. ${frankId}, consider this your final warning. I have to go mediate another 'father and son home issue' in the promenade.`,
  `Just approved the budget for 10,000 more screw knobs. San Vansterdam will be 100% un-skateable by Friday. You're welcome! Gotta run, ${frankId}, my OSHA recertification webinar is starting.`,

  `What is up my fellow board-shredders?! ${frankId}, can we synergize your street session with a sponsored M-CORP digital collectible drop? Think about it! Okay, my $3,000 electric scooter is fully charged, catching you dudes next fiscal quarter!`,
  `Knob Day is going to be so totally rad this year! Gluing knobs to ledges is just a really cool thing to do! Anyway, ${frankId}, I've got a matcha tasting at 3:00, so I'll peep your player engagement metrics next month! No cap!`,
  `San Vansterdam! We're pivoting the plaza into a crypto-mining hub! So stoked for the synergy! ${frankId}, tell your friends to invest! Anyway, my matcha is getting cold, zooming out!`,
  `Just a reminder that street skating is out, and M-CORP sanctioned VR-Hoverboarding is IN! It's totally boss, no cap! ${frankId}, I'm AFK for the next three weeks for a silent retreat in Bali. Peace!`,
  `Who's ready for Knob Day?! I just glued my 59 screw knobs to a rail and it felt incredibly empowering. You guys should try it! ${frankId}, catch you on the flip-side, my hover-plank needs a software update.`,

  `Um, Mr. Todd told me to drop this off. It's a bill for the bandwidth you're using in the plaza. Please don't yell at me ${frankId}, I'm already late to fetch Gary's dry cleaning and if I mess up my M-CORP internship is ruined. Bye!`,
  `Nobody panic! The lights just went off in the M-CORP server room but it's totally fine! I tripped over the cord! I have to go hide in the supply closet before Mr. Todd's wife eats another 200 chips from stress. ${frankId}, please delete this.`,
  `Mr. Todd told me to tell everyone the Isle of Grom is doing great, but I just saw him crying in his office. Please don't tell him I said that, ${frankId}. I have to go find Gary's missing clipboard.`,
  `Hey ${frankId}... did you see where I left the master keys to the M-CORP server room? Mr. Todd is screaming and his wife is buying more chips. I'm going to hide in the vents now.`,
  `I accidentally ordered 59,000 screw knobs instead of 59. Gary is going to end my internship. ${frankId}, if anyone asks, I was never here. I'm running away to the suburbs.`,
